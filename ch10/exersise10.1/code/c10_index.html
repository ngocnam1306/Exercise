          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>In late Spring 2021, we will present the two speakers, Dr. Paul Hessburg and Jane Pauley, we postponed from our last season. Your tickets and guest tickets will still be honored at that time and we have a record of your purchase, should it be needed. Dates for these lectures will be announced on our website and Facebook page when they are finalized.
            We thank you for your support and patience during these difficult times.</p>
